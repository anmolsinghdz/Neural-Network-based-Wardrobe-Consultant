# Neural-Network-based-Wardrobe-Consultant-
With an increase in the standard of living, peoples' attention gradually moved towards fashion that is concerned to be a popular aesthetic expression. Humans are inevitably drawn towards something that is visually more attractive. This tendency of humans has led to the development of the fashion industry over the course of time. However, given too many options of garments on the e-commerce websites, has presented new challenges to the customers in identifying their correct outfit. Thus, in this project, we proposed a personalized Fashion Recommender system that generates recommendations for the user based on an input given. Unlike the conventional systems that rely on the user's previous purchases and history, this project aims at using an image of a product given as input by the user to generate recommendations since many-a-time people see something that they are interested in and tend to look for products that are similar to that. We use neural networks to process the images from Fashion Product Images Dataset and the Nearest neighbour backed recommender to generate the final recommendations.

## Introduction
Humans are inevitably drawn towards something that is visually more attractive. This tendency of humans has led to development of fashion industry over the course of time. With introduction of recommender systems in multiple domains, retail industries are coming forward with investments in latest technology to improve their business. Fashion has been in existence since centuries and will be prevalent in the coming days as well. Women are more correlated with fashion and style, and they have a larger product base to deal with making it difficult to take decisions. It has become an important aspect of life for modern families since a person is more often than not judged based on his attire. Moreover, apparel providers need their customers to explore their entire product line so they can choose what they like the most which is not possible by simply going into a cloth store.

## Related work
In the online internet era, the idea of Recommendation technology was initially introduced in the mid-90s. Proposed CRESA that combined visual features, textual attributes and visual attention of the user to build the clothes profile and generate recommendations. Utilized fashion magazines photographs to generate recommendations. Multiple features from the images were extracted to learn the contents like fabric, collar, sleeves, etc., to produce recommendations. In order to meet the diverse needs of different users, an intelligent Fashion recommender system is studied based on the principles of fashion and aesthetics. To generate garment recommendations, customer ratings and clothing were utilized in The history of clothes and accessories, weather conditions were considered in to generate recommendations.

## Proposed methodology
In this project, we propose a model that uses Convolutional Neural Network and the Nearest neighbour backed recommender. As shown in the figure Initially, the neural networks are trained and then an inventory is selected for generating recommendations and a database is created for the items in inventory. The nearest neighbourâ€™s algorithm is used to find the most relevant products based on the input image and recommendations are generated.
